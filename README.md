   ```
   find all python files modified in the last week
   ```

2. **Press the suggestion key** (Option+\\ on macOS, Alt+\\ on Linux/Windows)

3. **Command appears:**
   ```
   find . -name "*.py" -mtime -7
   ```

**More Examples:**
```bash
# What you type → What you get
compress all jpg files → tar -czf images.tar.gz *.jpg
delete all node_modules → find . -name "node_modules" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +

   - -name "*.log": matches files ending with .log
   - -exec grep -l "ERROR" {} \;: runs grep on each file, showing only filenames that contain "ERROR"
   ```

### 🔧 Manual Commands

```

## Customization

### Custom Keybindings

## 🎨 Customization

### Custom Keybindings

The plugin includes default keybindings, but you can customize them in your `~/.zshrc`:

# Default keybindings (automatically set by plugin)
bindkey '»' zsh_claude_explain    # Option+Shift+\ on macOS
bindkey '«' zsh_claude_suggest    # Option+\ on macOS

# Custom alternatives
bindkey "^[s" zsh_claude_suggest   # Alt+s
bindkey "^[e" zsh_claude_explain   # Alt+e
bindkey "^@" zsh_claude_suggest    # Ctrl+space
```

> **macOS Users:** The actual characters `«` and `»` are produced by Option+\\ and Option+Shift+\\ respectively

### Available Widgets

- `zsh_claude_suggest`: Generate command suggestions
- `zsh_claude_explain`: Explain current command

### Configuration File

Advanced users can edit `~/.config/zsh-claude/config`:

```bash
ZSH_CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
ZSH_CLAUDE_MODEL="claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"
ZSH_CLAUDE_API_URL="https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages"
ZSH_CLAUDE_MAX_TOKENS="1000"
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Show loading messages even with Powerlevel10k instant prompt
export ZSH_CLAUDE_VERBOSE=1

# Add to ~/.zshrc before loading the plugin
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

<details>
<summary>Powerlevel10k instant prompt warning</summary>

**Problem:** Warning about console output during zsh initialization

**Solution:** This is normal behavior. The plugin automatically suppresses loading messages when Powerlevel10k instant prompt is detected.

To see loading messages anyway:
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc before loading the plugin
export ZSH_CLAUDE_VERBOSE=1
```

Or suppress the warning by adding to `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
typeset -g POWERLEVEL9K_INSTANT_PROMPT=quiet
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Missing dependencies</summary>

**Problem:** "Missing required dependencies" error

**Solution:** Install missing tools:
```bash
# macOS
brew install curl jq

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install curl jq

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install curl jq
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>API key issues</summary>

**Problem:** "No API key found" error

**Solution:** Run setup:
```bash
claude-setup
```

**Problem:** "API Error: invalid api key"

**Solution:**
1. Get a valid API key from [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
2. Run `claude-setup` to update your key
</details>

### Usage Issues

<details>
<summary>Keybindings not working</summary>

**Problem:** Keys don't trigger suggestions

**Solutions:**
1. Check terminal compatibility
2. Try custom keybindings (see Customization section)
3. Test with manual commands: `claude-suggest "test"`
</details>

<details>

**Problem:** Commands return no results

**Checklist:**
- ✅ Internet connection working

- ✅ API credits available
- ✅ Model name is correct
- ✅ Test with: `claude-suggest "list files"`
</details>

<details>
<summary>Performance issues</summary>

**Problem:** Slow responses
